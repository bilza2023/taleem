1: yes all correct

2: corect yes

3: 1--> No i think communication between plugins will be messy and add bugs each plugin shoud run and its result should be visible on canvas (CanvasPlayer.svelte). so that we can add and remove plugins to edit display.. the display should be the final result of all plugins ran. -- does this make sense?

3-2:: No once again plugins should just take data like "items" or "selectedItem" , currentTime , and return either 1: edited "items" 2: edited "selectedItem" 3: add display items to screen using post-pre draw. they should not have state but they can have congif options -- makes sense???

3: 3-- >Register their own event handlers : no they just use any of the technique to edit items / selectedItem or add display items throught preraw post draw .. in simple words i want pure functions which give output no internal state... makes sense????

3-4 Modify the items array? YES

4 : When you say "plugins can change the display of CanvasPlayer.svelte" - 
 - Through the preDraw/postDraw hooks --yes
 - editing items 
 - editing selectedItem (which is just 1 item from with in the items array)
 - act on mouse-events


 Now i dont know how can 1 plugin system  do all this?


 Do you want plugins to be:

Loaded dynamically or statically? -- NO .. at dev time -- keep it simple
Independent of each other or able to depend on other plugins? -- independent ..keep it simple
Able to be enabled/disabled at runtime? -- NO keep it simple
