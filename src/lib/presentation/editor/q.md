Here is my Idea: The component is actually "StackPanel" since it stack items (inside an array of objects in vertical manner.

so `slides` becomes `stackItems` 

const stackItems = [{title : 'canvas}];

currentSlideIndex become selectedItemIndex  

moveDown
moveUp remains the same

setCurrentSlideIndex = setSelectedIndex


what you say .. whats your idea
