# Slides For Taleem Presentation 

15-Nov-2024
I have completed CanvasPlayer as well as CanvasEditor. 
    - We have a small toolbar on top of both to help save and load created slides.
    - The CanvasEditor also created a new Slide (which means incase the slide formate changes then it needs to change here as well).
    - We can create canvas slides using Canvas Editor and then play then using CanvasPlayer.
