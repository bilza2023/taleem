# Slides For Taleem Presentation 


# Version 0.4.0 (30-Nov-2024)

- This library has 2 slides "Eqs" and "canvas". It means that we have Player and Editor for each slide.

- In future we will add more slides here as well.

- No major changes in the present slides just improve the code.

- KEEP IN MIND: that at this level we just deal with 1 slide since this is not a presentation level rather we are at slide level.

- This library also does not have "currentSlide" since that is also above this level of the app. We just export players and editors for each slide.

- We need "assets" from parent app (taleempresentation).

- We DO NOT  need to add "upgrade/diagnose" function here.. this layer should not know about old formats!!! .

### Pages/Routes

- There is an EqPlayer and Editor Pages which let you create an Eq slide and save it to the localstorage from which the EqPlayer reads and display.

- For canvas There is just CanvasEditor since it displays the canvas in editor directly so there is no need for a seperate player page here.


## Usage

### CanvasEditor:

```javascript
<div class="w-full bg-gray-700 text-white py-2 px-1 min-h-screen ">
  {#if slide && assets}
    <CanvasEditor
     bind:items = {slide.items}
     bind:slideExtra = {slide.slideExtra}
     {assets}
     {showAddToolbar}
    />
  {/if}
</div>
```
