**Status:** Stable  
**Audience:** Presentation creators · Teachers · Students · Content teams  
**Output:** Canonical `deck-v1` JSON

`taleem-builder` is part of the **Taleem** ecosystem.

It is the **authoring workspace** where slide decks are created.

> **This is where decks are born.**

## What is taleem-builder?

`taleem-builder` is an **authoring tool** for creating Taleem slide decks using a simple, readable JavaScript format.

Instead of writing fragile JSON by hand, you describe your slides step-by-step using a builder API, and the builder produces **correct, validated `deck-v1` JSON** that works everywhere in Taleem.

This is the layer where:
- lessons are written  
- presentations are structured  
- decks are generated (by humans or AI)

---

## Who is this for?

`taleem-builder` is for:

- **Teachers** preparing lessons
- **Students** creating structured explanations
- **Presentation creators** who want clarity and consistency
- **Content teams** building large slide libraries
- **AI systems** generating decks automatically
- Developers and pipelines (secondary)

If your goal is to **create slides**, this is the right package.

## Why not write JSON directly?

Because JSON is an output format — not a workspace.

`taleem-builder` is better than writing JSON by hand because:

1. **JSON is fragile**  
   One missing comma or field breaks everything.  
   JavaScript structure is safer and clearer.

2. **The builder enforces rules**  
   - slide order  
   - timing consistency  
   - slide validity  
   - (mobile mode restrictions — expanding over time)

3. **The builder prevents small mistakes**  
   Many subtle errors are caught automatically instead of failing later in a player.

4. **The format is AI-native**  
   Humans and AI can generate the **same builder code**.  
   (Including future Taleem-provided GPTs 👀)

JSON is what you *export*.  
Builder code is what you *author*.

## How it fits in the Taleem system

```

Authoring (you / AI)
↓
taleem-builder   ← this package
↓
Canonical JSON (deck-v1)
↓
taleem-player / browser / renderers

```

- **taleem-core** defines the slide language
- **taleem-builder** creates decks in that language
- **players** decide how decks are shown

The builder always follows the core schema — never the other way around.

---

## Golden builder example

This repository includes a **golden builder deck**:

```

src/samples/golden-builder-deck.js

```

This file:
- uses **all 21 canonical slide types**
- mirrors the golden JSON deck exactly
- is tested for lossless equivalence

It is the **reference example** for how to author decks correctly.

If this file builds, the builder is correct.

---

## Documentation & examples

- **Builder API (copy-paste ready):** `docs/api.md`
- **Golden authoring example:** `src/samples/golden-builder-deck.js`
- **Slide language & schema:** see `taleem-core` / `taleem-player` docs

---

## What this package does NOT do

`taleem-builder` does **not**:

- render slides
- play slides
- animate content
- manage UI, browser state, or audio

If something appears on screen, it belongs in a player — not here.

---

## Stability promise

- The builder API evolves **with `deck-v1`**
- No breaking changes inside a deck version
- Future changes will arrive only with `deck-v2`

Existing decks must always continue to build.
