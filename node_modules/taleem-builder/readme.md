###### This is version 0 dont expect much

**taleem-builder** is the **official entrance into the Taleem ecosystem**.

It is an **offline authoring compiler** that lets you create Taleem presentations without writing raw JSON. Instead of hand-crafting schemas, authors describe *intent* through a small, strict API. The builder enforces structure, timing, and policy **at build time**, guaranteeing valid, future-proof decks.

## Why taleem-builder exists

Writing presentation JSON by hand does not scale.
Rules get broken, mobile breaks silently, and runtime code becomes complex.

`taleem-builder` solves this by acting as a **compiler**:

- Authors write *meaning*, not structure
- Policies (mobile, slide restrictions, timing) are enforced early
- Output is always canonical and validated
- Runtime players stay simple and dumb

If Taleem is the presentation engine, **taleem-builder is how serious content enters the system**.

---

## What it produces

From a single authoring source, the builder can produce multiple targets:

- **Taleem JSON** (`deck-v1`) — for Taleem Player
- **Self-contained HTML** (planned) — one file that just opens and runs  
  *(no bundlers, no installs, no servers)*

Same meaning. Different delivery.

## Core concepts

### Slide-first authoring
Slides are the atomic unit.  
There are no canvas primitives, no layout instructions, no DOM concerns.

```js
builder.titleSlide(...)
builder.eq(...)
builder.imageLeftBulletsRight(...)
````

### EQ is a pillar (Not fully implemented yet)

The `eq` slide is a **reading-first presentation system**:

* Line-by-line reasoning
* Sidebar math, text, and images
* Naturally mobile-first

Flat EQ input is **compiled** into canonical structure during build.

### Compile-time policy

Rules live in the builder, not the renderer.

Examples:

* Mobile mode blocks unsafe slide types
* Invalid timing throws immediately
* EQ sidebar items cannot appear before a line

No guessing. No silent failures.

---

## Usage (minimal example)

```js
import TaleemBuilder from "taleem-builder";

const builder = new TaleemBuilder({ mode: "mobile" });

builder.addDetails({ name: "intro" });

builder.titleSlide(10, [
  { name: "title", content: "Welcome", showAt: 0 }
]);

builder.eq(30, [
  { type: "math", content: "E = mc^2", showAt: 10 },
  { type: "spText", content: "Energy–mass equivalence" }
]);

const deck = builder.build(); // validated deck-v1 JSON
```

---

## What taleem-builder is NOT

* ❌ Not a renderer
* ❌ Not a runtime library
* ❌ Not a canvas or layout engine
* ❌ Not a JSON helper

It is a **compiler**.

---

## Design principles (locked)

* One schema (`deck-v1`)
* One validator (from `taleem-core`)
* Authoring helpers compile to canonical output
* Renderer never contains policy
* Mobile is portrait-first and explicit
* EQ is first-class, not a feature

---

## Status

* Core API: **stable**
* EQ compilation: **complete**
* Mobile policy: **compile-time enforced**
* HTML export: **planned**
* PDF / LMS targets: **future**
