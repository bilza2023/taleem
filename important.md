# Flat is better than Nested

I want to create 1 app for all my 3 levels `slides level` , `presentation-level` and finally `taleem-level`. Since when i import a project into another it is just importing a folder so lets have the folder directly inside in a flat manner rather than vertical embedding.

src
    /slides
    /presentation
    /taleem

    ================

is it possible to write totally dumb components.
