# Taleem Project — Final Decisions & Action Plan (Jan 2026)

> This document captures **decisions**, **rationale**, and a **clear to‑do list** based on the mobile‑mode discussion. This is the contract moving forward.

---

## 1. Communicating With Users (IMPORTANT)

At ~1200 weekly downloads, this is no longer a hobby signal — it’s a **responsibility signal**.

### Primary channels (do these first)

* **GitHub Discussions** — primary communication hub

  * Announcements
  * Roadmap & decisions
  * Design rationale (like mobile mode)

* **README “Status + Direction” section**

  * One short paragraph stating:

    * Project is stable
    * Desktop‑first, mobile‑mode supported
    * Clear philosophy

### Optional but high‑leverage

* **CHANGELOG.md** — human‑readable, decision‑oriented
* **Pinned Discussion: “Read this before using Taleem”**

> Do **not** start Discord/Slack yet. Too early, too noisy.

---

## 2. Core Decisions (LOCKED)

These are no longer open questions.

### Mobile philosophy

* Mobile is **consumption**, not performance
* Desktop is **presentation**, not reading
* Mobile is **portrait‑first**
* Landscape is an enhancement, never a dependency

### Technology

* Same engine
* Same schema
* Same renderer
* **No new tech stack**

### Responsibility

* Library is responsible for correctness and clarity
* Author is responsible for mobile suitability
* Unsafe slides must be **declared**, not guessed

---

## 3. What “Mobile Mode” Means (FINAL)

Mobile mode is:

* A **CSS layer** (`taleem.mobile.css`)
* A **renderer mode flag** (`mode: "mobile" | "desktop"`)
* A **set of authoring rules**
* A **restricted slide surface**

Mobile mode is **not**:

* A new product
* A new schema
* A forked renderer

---

## 4. Authoring Rules for Mobile (FINAL)

These rules are complete and sufficient:

1. One idea per slide — no simultaneous comparisons
2. Vertical flow only — content reads top‑to‑bottom
3. Text must be readable without zooming
4. Images must survive full‑width stacking
5. No dense tables or multi‑column grids
6. Slides may declare `mobileUnsafe: true`

**Rule:** If a slide only works in landscape → it is `mobileUnsafe`.

---

## 5. DeckBuilder — Final Role Definition

DeckBuilder is a **compiler**, not a runtime tool.

### Characteristics

* Offline
* Authoring‑only
* Outputs Taleem JSON
* Hides schema complexity
* Enforces rules early

### In mobile mode

* Using a forbidden slide type → **panic & stop**
* Invalid structure → **panic & stop**
* Author feedback is immediate

### API philosophy

* Simple
* Explicit
* No JSON written by hand

Example mental model:

```js
slideType.add(...)
// repeat
build()
```

---

## 6. Final To‑Do List

### A. Ready to Code ✅

* Add `taleem.mobile.css`
* Add `mode: "mobile" | "desktop"` to renderer
* Block known mobile‑unsafe slide types in mobile mode
* Support `mobileUnsafe: true` flag
* Update README with mobile philosophy
* Open GitHub Discussions + pin direction post

### B. Needs Design 🧠

* Identify **mobile‑safe slide whitelist**
* Identify **mobile‑unsafe slide blacklist**
* Decide which slides degrade vs which are blocked
* Decide mobile‑only slide types (if any)

### C. Documentation‑Only 📝

* Write “Mobile Mode Contract” doc
* Write “Author Responsibility” section
* Add FAQ: “Why doesn’t this slide work on mobile?”

---

## 7. Status Statement (Suggested)

> Taleem v1.0 provides a stable JSON‑to‑presentation engine. Desktop presentation is the reference experience. Mobile mode is supported for content consumption using a portrait‑first, rule‑based approach. Some slide types are intentionally restricted on mobile to preserve clarity and meaning.

---

## 8. Final Note

Shipping is a **decision**, not a condition.

You have:

* A stable core
* A clear philosophy
* Explicit contracts
* Shared responsibility

From here on, you are in **maintenance with direction**, not uncertainty.
Policy lives in DeckBuilder, not in the renderer — YES
