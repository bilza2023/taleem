Project: HEALTH
Purpose

HEALTH is a short-term personal stabilization project focused on restoring baseline energy, mental clarity, and daily rhythm.

This project is not about performance or optimization.
It is about damage control, survival, and consistency.

The goal is to complete 7–10 uninterrupted days of stability before resuming intensive work.

Core Principle

Survive first. Optimize later.

For the first phase:

No pressure to overwork

No self-judgment

No long-term promises

Completion is defined as showing up daily, not achieving outcomes.

Language Rules (Intentional Framing)

To keep the system calm and non-reactive:

Avoid emotionally charged words

Use neutral terms only

Approved Terms

Cravings → mental noise / urges

Triggers → friction points

Relief actions → stabilizers

Slip risk → high-friction period

Reset → recovery action

We never name the habit directly.
We focus only on states and responses.

Phase 1: Stabilization (Days 1–7)
Objective

Maintain physical and mental safety while reducing internal friction.

Success Criteria

Day completed without escalation

Body fed, hydrated, rested

One reset action used when needed

That’s it.

Daily Structure (Minimal)
Morning

Wake up (no fixed time requirement)

Hydration + light food

Short walk or stretch

Note baseline energy (low / medium / high)

Midday

One optional light-focus task (≤90 minutes)

Balanced meal

Rest or idle time allowed

Evening (High Friction Window)

Warm drink

Low-stimulation activity

Early wind-down

No problem-solving or debates

Craving (Mental Noise) Protocol

When mental noise appears:

Pause — no immediate reaction

Apply one Relief Action:

Walk

Water

Warm drink

Cold face splash

Delay 15 minutes

Resume neutral activity

Mental noise is treated as temporary weather, not a command.

Relief Actions (Stabilizers)

Walking

Stretching

Breathing

Writing one sentence

Warm shower

Quiet background audio

Relief actions are not rewards — they are tools.

Work Policy

During Phase 1:

No long coding marathons

No deadlines

No “catching up”

Work is allowed only if it reduces stress, not increases it.

Emotional Policy

Irritation is expected

Emotional intensity is not analyzed

No big decisions

No identity conclusions

All strong emotions are labeled:

“Temporary system recalibration”

End-of-Day Log (2 minutes max)

Record only:

Day number

Energy level

What helped today

One sentence: “Today I survived.”

No metrics. No scoring.

Phase Completion

Phase 1 ends after 7 stable days.

Only after that:

Gradual increase in focus

Return to structured work

Performance goals allowed

Project Motto

Stability first. Output later.

If you want, next we can:

Turn this into a README.md

Convert it into a daily JSON / YAML log format

Add a “High Friction Emergency Page”

Or design Phase 2: Momentum (Days 8–30)
