    1. `Data Layer`: What allowed me to finalize this app was the concept of `data layer`. This is the lowest level of an app which just export static data structures and static methods , imports nothing and is the only source of truth.Keep in mind that `data layer` is not the database rather the `Schemas` (Structs , js Objects etc).

    2. `Exporting Maps` :Using and `exporting Maps` is a great way to export a group of objects since we can look it up using the keys.  

    3. Creating seperate objects for data layer and editor (`static-items` and `edit-items`). I had to since i had to incarporate data layer but this also imprived my code since both the concernes were seperated.
