> The dev diary is a liner record of happening as per data. all we need in data and comment and some context. 

### Rules for Dev Dieary
    1. Do no go back fo forward and go linear. This is a linear record just like ideas and thought flow.
    2. Later i can extract some important points from it.
    3: i can easily give context (for example i am working on x project and y module and testing z strategy) and the later entries are about the same context.
    4: i can create openly any new para number list , heading etc etc. 
    5: Do no try to make it a digital record just keep it what it is.
    6: also do not go back and edit things, every thing is correct at the time it was written.
    7: dont waste time in editing
