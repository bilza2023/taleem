    <h1>What Taleem Is</h1>

    <p>
      Taleem is a system for creating educational slide presentations using
      structured JSON instead of visual slide editors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is not flexibility or design freedom. The goal is clarity,
      consistency, and cognitive calm for learners.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most presentation tools optimize for marketing, animation, and visual
      novelty. Taleem deliberately avoids these priorities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taleem assumes the user is a teacher, educator, or content author who
      cares more about explaining ideas than decorating slides.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slides in Taleem are predictable by design. This predictability reduces
      distraction and allows students to focus on concepts instead of layout.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are looking for a general-purpose slideshow tool, Taleem is
      likely not a good fit. If you are building lessons, it is.
