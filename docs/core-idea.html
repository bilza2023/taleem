    <h1>Core Idea: JSON → Slides</h1>

    <p>
      Taleem treats a presentation as structured data, not as a canvas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every slide is described using JSON. The structure of that JSON
      determines what appears on screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no timeline editor, no drag-and-drop interface, and no
      animation scripting.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach makes presentations easier to version, review,
      validate, and reuse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because slides are data, they can be generated, transformed,
      validated, and tested like any other artifact.
    </p>

    <p>
      The browser is a renderer, not an editor. The data always remains the
      source of truth.
